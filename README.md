# My 3D Portfolio

## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to my **3D Portfolio**! This project showcases my work and skills as a **Multi-Disciplinary Developer**. The portfolio features a visually stunning 3D environment built with **Three.js** and **React**, along with **Node.js** for backend functionalities like sending messages via email using **Nodemailer**.

Feel free to explore and interact with the dynamic elements, and learn more about my skills, projects, and the technologies I work with.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js**: For building dynamic and responsive components.

  - **Nodemailer**: For sending email notifications from the contact form.
